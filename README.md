# Compilation

a working compiler that can compile a large subset of Scheme into Intel x86, 64-bit
assembly language, and then, using the Newtide Assembler (nasm), assemble it into a standalone
executable.


##**The files for the project**

• code-gen.ml: This is the additional code in ocaml. This code implements
the constants table, the free-variables table, the interface for the Code_Generation module,
the Code_Generation module itself, and many support functions.

• **compiler.ml:** code-gen.ml combines with my reader, tag-parser, and semantic
analyser code, into a single file called compiler.ml.

• prologue-1.asm: This is a template header for the assembly language generated by my
compilers. It includes the definitions of the run-time type-information (RTTI), and various
macros that make writing the compiler much easier.

• prologue-2.asm: This is some more boilerplate code that is sandwiched in side the start of
my assembly-language output.

• epilogue.asm: This is the file that ends the main function, where compiled user-code is
located, followed by over 1600 lines of assembly-language routines.

• makefile: This is the makefile that I use to assemble the code generated by the compiler.

• init.scm: This a Scheme source file that is loaded by my compiler, ahead of any user-code,
and provides some additional built-in procedures. The lower-level procedures are implemented
in assmebly-language and are located in the epilogue.asm file. But anything that can be
implemented practically in Scheme, really should be, and this file contains over 90 procedures
that were implemented in Scheme.
